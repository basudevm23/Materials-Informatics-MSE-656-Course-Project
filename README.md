Contents:

processed_features.csv: This csv file was used as the primary dataset for training the models, namely Linear Regression, DT and Random Forests, and finally Graph Neural Networks

GB_Energies_datasets.ipynb: Codes for data cleaning and merging of various datasets, to produce the final raw dataset

Grain_boundary_features.ipynb: Codes for data processing. This produces the cleaned "processed_features.csv"

Linear_Regression_and_its_Variations.ipynb: Training a linear regression model on the primary dataset

DT and Random Forest.ipynb: Training a DT and Random Forest model on the primary dataset

Graph Neural Networks.ipynb: Training GNNs on the primary dataset
